In this session we'll explore a game engine written in C#/.NET and XNA that
emulates and improves upon the classic DOS game from 1991, 'ZZT'. ZZT is a
text-based adventure game where the player is represented as a smiley face
(ASCII 0x1 in code page 437). As the player, you can move between screens known
as 'boards', collect gems and ammo, shoot monsters and interact with objects.
ZZT was and is so popular that people are still to this day playing and creating
ZZT worlds. Some of the topics we'll cover include:

* objects
* commands
* events
* serialization
* use of XNA
